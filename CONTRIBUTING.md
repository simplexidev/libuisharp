# Contributing to SDFx

For starters, thank you for taking the time to at least consider contributing to this project. We try to create a stable project, fix bugs and add features continuously, and without your help, it wouldn't be possible.

## Getting started

### Check out the Roadmap

If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the [issues](https://github.com/simplexidev/sdfx/issues) or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to add/fix it! Although, it's generally best to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests (once finished).

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **main**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. I will let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Tests

This needs done, and I'm working on it. (But anyone is more than welcome to help with this, since I have no knowledge of `mstest`.)

### Documentation

I'm working on writing documentation after I finish the code, but the general rule of thumb is to write it as you code it.
