LibUISharp is a library containing bindings for [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui). Currently, LibUISharp is only built as a .NET Standard 2.0 library, but can also support other frameworks as-per community interest.

**Please Note**: [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) is *mid-alpha* software, meaning the underlying API in LibUISharp is a work-in-progress. Any LibUISharp releases up until v0.4.0 are CI builds, and are not guaranteed to work.

## Features

LibUISharp allows you to create native, cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) applications containing various controls, such as a `Button` or a `TabControl`, laid out in containers, such as a `GroupContainer`, or a `StackContainer`.

Check out the demos in the `demos\` folder for examples.

## Supported Platforms

Although LibUISharp can be used on [any platform supported by .NET Core 2.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1-supported-os.md), only 64-bit platforms are currently supported.

## Obtaining the Library

LibUISharp is almost up-to-par with libui and is now available on NuGet!

Just add this line to you `csproj` project file:

```
<PackageReference Include="LibUISharp" Version="0.4.0-build-*" />
```
